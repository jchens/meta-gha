# Prototype Goals
After additional research and brainstorming, we narrowed in on our idea to use first-person narratives to provide an engaging and informative experience for the user. 
our key goals were to:
* Connect the user to cultural history
* Build empathy through different perspectives
* Engage and incentivize the users

# Prototype
To achieve and test these goals, we created a low-fidelity prototype using Figma.
