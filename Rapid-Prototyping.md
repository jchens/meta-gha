# Creating Our Prototype
We considered numerous historical points of interest for our prototype, and ultimately decided on the Tomb of Emperor Tu Duc due to its potential for strong perspectives (like Emperor Tu Duc himself) and new knowledge that most people wouldn't already have.


## Details
To accomplish this, we envisioned 4 areas of interaction for our prototype:
* Map: Users can walk around and see the buildings and landmarks associated with the Tomb of Tu Duc
* Narrative: Users can listen to a first-person poem from Emperor Tu Duc himself, detailing his life.
* Minigame: Users can participate in activities that Tu Duc and citizens of the time would do.
* Trivia: Users can earn a badge of completion by answering questions about the knowledge they just gained.

## Goals
After additional research and brainstorming, we narrowed in on our idea to use first-person narratives to provide an engaging and informative experience for the user. 

Our key goals were to:
* Connect the user to cultural history
* Build empathy through different perspectives
* Engage and incentivize the users

## Gathering User Feedback
To make sure we were meeting those goals, we tested our prototype with 8 individuals.

## Figma
To achieve and test these goals, we created a low-fidelity prototype using Figma.
