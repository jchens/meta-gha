## INTRO / GENERAL HISTORY 
Welcome to the historic Mesa Verda. Around 600AD, people living in the Four Corners region made Mesa Verde their home. For more than 700 years, they and their descendants lived here, building elaborate stone cliff dwellings, which you will explore today. 

Inhabitants of Mesa Verde are renowned for their artisanship, buildmanship, and agricultural prowess. On your journey, you will interact with an Artisan, a Builder, and a Farmer in search of the secrets of this site. Impressive and mystifying, much about Mesa Verde is still unknown to researchers and archeologists. On your journey, you are an artifact assistant with a thirst for knowledge and a desire to be promoted and renowned as a true archeological expert. Few know the true history and tales of Mesa Verde and we need you to interview historical figures, dig through artifacts, and pass the Mesa Verde archeological board earning the gold badge, representing the highest honor of Archeological Expert.

## FARMER XOI (Experience of Interest)

### POI#1 (monologue): 
By nature, I’m a provider. My ancestors and I have been growing Maize, or “corn” as you might know it, since 450 CE, making up 75-80% of the diet of my fellow Pueblans. After we’ve grown the Maize (corn), it is our tradition to grind it before we cook it. While corn is my specialty and what I am best known for, I’ve also developed skills growing beans and squash, passed down from my family.  

For many many years before 1100, farmers lived near their crops but my people represent a historic shift of farmers who chose to leave near sources of water and walk long distances to reach their crops. As a farmer, I feel at home in Mesa Verde and make up the backbone and large percent of the population of this dwelling. 


LEADING QUESTION TO ENCOURAGE MINI GAME??? 


### IX #1: MINIGAME,  NEED SOME HELP
Minigame: Help the farmer locate the tool they need to prepare the corn in the traditional Mesa Verde way before they cook it 

“I’m glad you’re here because I was just about to prepare a recent corn crop for cooking, I’ve seemed to have misplaced some of my tools. Can you help me [find the tools I need to ] prepare the corn?” 

### ORIGINAL: Maize, also known as corn, originated in Meso-America and was grown in Mesa Verde beginning around 450 CE. Along with beans and squash, corn was a mainstay of the Ancestral Pueblo diet, making up 75-80% of what they consumed. Ancestral Pueblo farmers found ways to adapt to Mesa Verde's temperate climates by becoming skilled at dryland farming and growing drought-tolerant varieties of corn that would mature quickly to accommodate a short growing season.

Corn was traditionally prepared using a mano (a handheld stone tool) and metate (the larger stone mortar), which were used for grinding corn before it was cooked. 



### POI#2:
The arid climate around here is not easy-growing conditions, and I’ve had to become skilled at dryland farming to adapt to Mesa Verde’s temperate climate. Some ways I’ve learned to combat the dry weather and short farming seasons is to grow drought-tolerant varieties of Maize that mature quickly. 

The dryness is not the only part of the climate that makes farming difficult here. My ancestors and I have had to learn how to navigate frequent lightning strikes and inundation of dense overgrowth. 

### ORIGINAL: Due to an arid climate, frequent lightning strikes, and inundation of dense overgrowth, Mesa Verde has experienced numerous large-scale wildfires over the past few decades. From 1996-2003, five major wildfires burned over 50% of the park's acreage. Fires like these put alcove cliff dwellings at risk, allow invasive plants to overtake the old-growth Pinyon-Juniper forests, and make the soil hydrophobic by creating a waxy layer on top of the soil's surface. As a result, water rushed into gullies, causing erosion that uncovered previously unknown archeological sites and artifacts and exposing burial sites sacred to the Pueblo people.


## BUILDER XOI 

### POI #1: The Balcony House was found to be constructed in the 100 years between 1200-1300 AD. It was a mid-sized village of 38 rooms and two kivas and probably housed up to 30 people.

Today, the tunnel, passageways, and modern 32-foot entrance ladder make it the most adventurous cliff-dwelling tour in the park. Notice the small ledge beneath the second-story entry on the structure. It is from this “balcony” that the site received its name.

### POI#2: Mesa Verde is best known for its well-preserved, multi-storied cliff dwellings. The structures contained within these alcoves were built out of sandstone, plastered together with adobe mortar. Archaeologists believe these were important centers where many people gathered to trade and socialize. 

### POI#3: Kivas were roofed underground structures which played a role in many aspects of ancient Puebloan's daily life. Archaeologists believe that Kivas were buildings that served as religious, economic, and government centers for entire communities. Their roofs acted as a central courtyard where daily work and living took place. The presence of sipapus—symbolic features thought to represent the hole through which humans climbed into this world—indicates that kivas were also a focal point for ritual activities at the household level.


## ARTISAN XOI 
### POI#1: The people of Mesa Verde were skilled artisans with a complex economy. Beginning with basketry, ancient Puebloans created advanced techniques to weave waterproof baskets for carrying water, storing grain, and even for cooking. By about 550 AD, basketry declined in favor of pottery. Numerous designs such as pots, bowls, canteens, ladles, jars, and mugs were made for cooking and storage. Intricately decorated earthenware pottery may have also been used for ceremonial purposes. The Pueblo people's skill and efficiency with these mediums allowed them to create a surplus that they could share or trade with neighboring communities.


## GENERAL BACKGROUND   
### POI #1: By the late 1270s, the population began migrating south into present-day New Mexico and Arizona. By 1300, the Puebloan occupation of Mesa Verde had ended.

Today more than 60,000 Pueblo Indians live in 32 pueblos in New Mexico and Arizona and one pueblo in Texas. Some travel back to maintain their cultural identity and a strong spiritual connection with their ancestors.

### POI #2: A lot of careful planning, expertise, and physical labor goes into preserving the Ancestral Puebloan sites. While most of this work was accomplished in the early 1900s and during the Wetherill Mesa Project of the late 1950s to early 1960s, factors such as rainfall, erosion, animals, and tourism all impact the site's architecture. As a result, all archeological sites, especially multi-storied ones like Balcony House, require constant assessment and maintenance.
