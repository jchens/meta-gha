Thank you for purchasing the "Science Lab - Mortar and Pestle" pack from KittandaDesign

This is a simple asset pack that contains 8 prefabs from a mesh created by me. 

I have set up the prefabs in the Prefab folder for you to drag and drop into your scenes. Each prefab has two parts, the base Mortar model and the Pestle model. They are parented to a GameObject for easier placing. The GameObject has a centered pivot, but the Mortar model has a pivot at its base and the Pestle model has a pivot at its center. I feel this is the best way to use them.

Model
-----
The real world scale of the mortar is 105mm wide and deep and 50mm high. The Pestle is 690mm tall and 460mm at its widest. 

Pivots are baked and UVs are unwrapped

Textures
--------

8 Texture sets were made using a PBR workflow. Output is targa files, Albedo, AO, Normal, Specular. Each material in Unity was set up using the standard specular setup. 

Black Glass, Cast Iron, Hard Wood (Oak), Marble, Rough Granite, Smooth Granite, Volcanic Sand, White Ceramic. 

The reason for choosing these was based on some research I did on the types of Mortar and Pestles you get and found that these types each were used for different things and could withstand different heat, therefore it seemed fitting to have them all available. 


Scripts
-------

I wrote a Controller Script for the experience called "ExampleSceneController" and is used to run the example scene. All it does is rotate the center display area if there is a object to display and houses a number of Arrays that you can populate with things you want to display. Feel free to use this code and the objects I have added to the scene for your own work if you choose. 

If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me as I am always happy to create more materials for my 
models or work on commissions!

Hope you have a great day further!
