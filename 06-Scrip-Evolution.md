# Mid-way Draft

## POV Motivation

## Feedback from Adam Tobin

## Feedback from Script Consultant

With help from Adam, we connected with Sofia, who has experience with screenwriting and writing historical fiction.

### Summary of Feedback:
* Give your user (the main character) a better reason to be there and to interact with the other characters. They should be motivated by an external goal and not just assumed to be motivated by a desire to learn.
    * We want the other characters to say "We need you! You're the only one who can help."
* Flesh out the Farmer/Artisan/Builder characters: they should have names and unique traits.
