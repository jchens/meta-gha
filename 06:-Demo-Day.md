TODO EMILY: 

TODO: think these questions can be answered under ["Refining Our Prototype"](https://github.com/cs210/2022-Meta2/wiki/05.0:-Refining-Our-Prototype), since the feedback post-rapid prototyping was the main foundation for this iteration.

# Prototype
[[Figma]](https://www.figma.com/proto/hRpETb4iWhGwjOG1itKpex/Demo%3A-Mesa-Verde?page-id=201%3A990&node-id=201%3A1053&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.47&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=201%3A1053&show-proto-sidebar=1)

Our demo prototype was a mixture of Figma (for the map, characters, and trivia) and Unity (for the interactive experiences and trivia).
