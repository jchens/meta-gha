[[Script: Final Draft]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_SijQJ2b7o-qewp4znXbVXI9_-6XGWffc9aWzhhns0/edit?usp=sharing)

Our demo prototype was a mixture of Figma (for the map, characters, and trivia) and Unity (for the interactive experiences and trivia).

## Entrance
* Before you enter Mesa Verde, you can see how much progress you've made exploring & learning so far
* Choose your own adventure: 1) explore the world or 2) complete the trivia directly.

## Intro

# Looking to Next Quarter
TODO, from Hassan: "You don't need to have a full answer on the Loop and Drivers questions. We could even dedicate ~30 minutes to working more on that together. However, those are useful questions for us to answer to align on and prioritize explorations next quarter."

## Insights
What are the top insights you developed this quarter? I can also review these in advance if you share them.

* Characters
    * Naming, voice acting, and recording the movements of the character added to the immersion
* Trivia
    * 70/30 rule - Users should be able to answer/reasonably guess 70% of the questions, with the other 30% stumping the user.

## Loop
What is the core loop / user journey (we also call this a story map) you want to keep exploring next quarter?

## Drivers
How do you want people to feel at various stages of the loop (eager to win, eager to collaborate, curious to learn more, etc)?
