TODO EMILY: 

these q's might be answerable under ["Refining Our Prototype"](https://github.com/cs210/2022-Meta2/wiki/05.0:-Refining-Our-Prototype), since the feedback post-rapid prototyping was the main foundation for this iteration. 

* What are the "tailwinds" that have given us conviction in our idea?
* Why are we going with the final prototype we are going with?

# Looking to Next Quarter
TODO, from Hassan: "You don't need to have a full answer on the Loop and Drivers questions. We could even dedicate ~30 minutes to working more on that together. However, those are useful questions for us to answer to align on and prioritize explorations next quarter."

## Insights
* What are the top insights you developed this quarter? I can also review these in advance if you share them.

## Loop
* What is the core loop / user journey (we also call this a story map) you want to keep exploring next quarter?
    * TODO: user journey diagram

## Drivers
* How do you want people to feel at various stages of the loop (eager to win, eager to collaborate, curious to learn more, etc)? 
    * TODO: user journey diagram
