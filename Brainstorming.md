# Initial Brainstorming
Our brainstorming process began with proposing and researching features individually. After this individual process, we consolidated the features into several themes.

## Themes
* Adding friends, advanced chat
* Mini games/activities
* Different perspectives
* Learning through exploration
* Learning through time
* Reward systems
* Collectibles

# Feature Brainstorming
To brainstorm concrete ideas for features to be placed into GHA, we play-tested and researched several games such as Minecraft or Uncharted. Using these experiences, we identified key features that stood out to us and proposed how they might be integrated into GHA.
