# Product Decisions

We received an amazing response and insightful feedback from rapid prototyping, and felt ready to create a medium fidelity prototype in preparation for demo day. With this iteration, we made a few significant product decisions:

### Finalizing the Location
To ensure that we were focusing most of our time on creating an engaging game instead of just conducting research on the Tomb of Tu Duc, we decided to adapt the existing script attached for site visits to Mesa Verde in GHA. Since all the historical details were already well researched, we could use it as a solid foundation for our next prototype. 

### Selecting Characters & POVs

[üìù [Original Mesa Verde Script for GHA]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z3CuB91EQlXamjqdw4wjIk75DBxLiPxz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100514480962887907042&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Based on the Mesa Verde script, we were able to identify 3 POVs we could focus on for our user's journey through Mesa Verde: the farmer, the builder, and the artisan. We chose these POVs because they represented key roles in the Ancestral Pueblo community, and had the potential for historically significant and culturally relevant learning opportunities. 

These 3 characters became the foundation for our final script, guiding the journey our user takes through Mesa Verde as they experience the everyday lives of Puebloans.

### Refining the Game Structure
Considering our 3 characters, we mapped out the structure and interactions of our game as shown below. Each character has their own XOI (Experience of Interest) that consists of their narrative, site location, interactions, and historical information. XOIs provide a venue for information exchange through multiple channels which appeals to various learning styles.

# Script Decisions

To test their knowledge, users can take the trivia at the site. As some users in our initial interviews showed interest in taking the trivia before interacting with XOIs, we decided to allow users to take the trivia any time they wish. We iterated on the both trivia components: questions and format 

#### Trivia Questions
In our Tomb of Tu Duc trivia prototype, questions required specific knowledge of the historical site such as asking when Tu-Duc served as an emperor or where he was buried. We iterated on the questions as these type of questions could feel like those in history textbooks. After developing the characters in XOIs, we utilized their stories as an inspiration for trivia questions. Additionally, we wanted to keep the questions challenging, yet we did not want to frustrate the user, so we included various hints. Also, we worked to make them "flow into each other" as demonstrated by the questions below.

Example trivia questions (correct answer is in bold):

_‚ÄúWe chose to make our home here because of the nearby naturally-occuring seep springs. Unfortunately, that also means our rooms received little warmth from the sun during the winter months, since this alcove faces northeast.‚Äù_

_Who do you think most likely said this?_

A) Izel the Artisan

B) Aapo the Artisan

**C) Humberto the Builder**

D) Colel the Farmer


_The expert whose quote you read in the previous question helped build the Balcony House. What did Pueblo people use to build their villages such as the Balcony House?_


A) Ceramic Bricks

**B) Sandstone**

C) Burnt Clay Bricks

D) Wood


#### Trivia Format
We also iterated on the method of consumption for trivia. Our initial trivia prototype resembled a quiz-like format where user selects the correct answer. We wanted to shift away from this format as it does not make use of the affordances of VR environment. Upon researching successful consumption methods such as Jeopardy, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, etc., we decided to adopt a game-show-esque trivia format. To use the affordances of VR such as moving around, we decided to make it more interactive by having the users hit a target to answer a question. We zoomed in on testing the particular interaction of ‚Äúthrowing something‚Äù to answer and we will be testing this interaction.

#### Collectibles
To drive the user to solidify their knowledge, we created collectibles that are awarded based on the percentage of questions users answered correctly in trivia. There are two types of collectibles: GHA only and universal. "GHA only" awards are in the form of stamps (gold, silver, bronze) for user's passport to simulate a real life travel experience. Universal awards are those that can exist beyond GHA. An example could be a statue/gold cup that can be placed elsewhere in the metaverse!
