## Feedback on Draft 1 from screenwriting consultant:
* Give your user (your main character) a better reason to be there and a better reason to interact with the other characters. They should be motivated by an external goal and not by these;ves 
* Build your Farmer/Artisan/Builder characters up more. They should have names and traits
* TODO

# SCRIPT MID-WAY DRAFT 

## Story Outline / Goals 
**Target Audience** Adults who want to learn more about history (focusing on young adults 20-30s)
s

**Character** User is an “artifact assistant” 

**Goal** Character wants to be promoted to an archeologist expert 

**How Will They Accomplish Goal** Interacting with XOIs and gaining knowledge about the different parts of Mesa Verde (while enjoying themselves) so they can pass the mesa verde archeological board (ie. trivia game)  


## Intro (Narrator)

Welcome to the historic Mesa Verda. Around 600AD, people living in the Four Corners region made Mesa Verde their home. For more than 700 years, they and their descendants lived here, building elaborate stone cliff dwellings, which you will explore today. 

Inhabitants of Mesa Verde are renowned for their artisanship, buildmanship, and agricultural prowess. On your journey, you will interact with an Artisan, a Builder, and a Farmer in search of the secrets of this site. Impressive and mystifying, much about Mesa Verde is still unknown to researchers and archeologists. On your journey, you are an artifact assistant with a thirst for knowledge and a desire to be promoted and renowned as a true archeological expert. Few know the true history and tales of Mesa Verde and we need you to interview historical figures, dig through artifacts, and pass the Mesa Verde archeological board earning the gold badge, representing the highest honor of Archeological Expert.

## FARMER XOI (Experience of Interest)

### POI#1 (monologue): 
By nature, I’m a provider. My ancestors and I have been growing Maize, or “corn” as you might know it, since 450 CE, making up 75-80% of the diet of my fellow Pueblans. After we’ve grown the Maize (corn), it is our tradition to grind it before we cook it. While corn is my specialty and what I am best known for, I’ve also developed skills growing beans and squash, passed down from my family.  

For many many years before 1100, farmers lived near their crops but my people represent a historic shift of farmers who chose to leave near sources of water and walk long distances to reach their crops. As a farmer, I feel at home in Mesa Verde and make up the backbone and large percent of the population of this dwelling. 


### IX #1: MINIGAME
Minigame: Help the farmer locate the tool they need to prepare the corn in the traditional Mesa Verde way before they cook it 

“I’m glad you’re here because I was just about to prepare a recent corn crop for cooking, I’ve seemed to have misplaced some of my tools. Can you help me [find the tools I need to ] prepare the corn?” 

### Original Meta Script: 
Maize, also known as corn, originated in Meso-America and was grown in Mesa Verde beginning around 450 CE. Along with beans and squash, corn was a mainstay of the Ancestral Pueblo diet, making up 75-80% of what they consumed. Ancestral Pueblo farmers found ways to adapt to Mesa Verde's temperate climates by becoming skilled at dryland farming and growing drought-tolerant varieties of corn that would mature quickly to accommodate a short growing season.

Corn was traditionally prepared using a mano (a handheld stone tool) and metate (the larger stone mortar), which were used for grinding corn before it was cooked. 



### POI#2 (monologue):
The arid climate around here is not easy-growing conditions, and I’ve had to become skilled at dryland farming to adapt to Mesa Verde’s temperate climate. Some ways I’ve learned to combat the dry weather and short farming seasons is to grow drought-tolerant varieties of Maize that mature quickly. 

The dryness is not the only part of the climate that makes farming difficult here. My ancestors and I have had to learn how to navigate frequent lightning strikes and inundation of dense overgrowth. 

### Original Meta Script: 
Due to an arid climate, frequent lightning strikes, and inundation of dense overgrowth, Mesa Verde has experienced numerous large-scale wildfires over the past few decades. From 1996-2003, five major wildfires burned over 50% of the park's acreage. Fires like these put alcove cliff dwellings at risk, allow invasive plants to overtake the old-growth Pinyon-Juniper forests, and make the soil hydrophobic by creating a waxy layer on top of the soil's surface. As a result, water rushed into gullies, causing erosion that uncovered previously unknown archeological sites and artifacts and exposing burial sites sacred to the Pueblo people.
