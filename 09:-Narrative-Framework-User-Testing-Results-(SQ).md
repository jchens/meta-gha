We focused our Narrative Testing framework in two stages (1) Site Expert Testing at the end of Spring Quarter and (2) Initial clarity testing mid-Spring Quarter after developing the Narrative Framework in early Spring. Please find the most recent Site Expert testing at the top and the initial clarity testing from the Breakathon below. 

# 1. Site Expert Testing 
We tested our Narrative Framework with Site Expert such as historians, academics, historical site directors as well as Stanford tour guides. At the start of the testing sessions, we introduced the site experts the task of designing a historical story for GHA and presented how the narrative framework could be applied to an example historical site. After having the interviewees work on their story and complete the worksheets we provide them with, we collected their feedback using the form below.

Our testing structure involved:
1. Introduce our project
2. blah blah next step TODO by Jessica

## Site Experts

### Matt Shimura
Matt Shimura is an Associate Technical Project Manager at Meta and he crafted two historical stories that take place at the Capitol Hill building. His feedback helped us refine our narrative framework in a way that the prompts are more clear and that there is more scaffolding provided for story creation.


### Julia Milani
Julia Milani studied History at Stanford University and was a tour guide on campus. The setting of her story is Roble Arts Gym and her feedback helped us revise the instructions on how to use the narrative framework.

    
*Note on why we tested with tour guides -- this was a unique contribution Meta hasn't spent much time on, there whole job is making the sites ENGAGING

TODO Etc. any other expert test sessions -- ie. note about all email attempts sent out, responses back from the most recent batch with photos at Cantor, email from Jessica's history prof connection 


## Takeaways and Action Plan

Each interview presents the site expert testers an opportunity to create unique stories. Therefore, we analysed each interview summary individually and created the following interview reports that list the action items resulted from that particular interview.

# 2. Breakathon 
The class Breakathon was our first chance to test the first draft of our scalable Narrative Framework! While our users were not Site Experts, we were excited to use this opportunity to primarily test the framework's **clarity** and **creative inspiration**. 

From the session, we hoped to adapt the narrative framework to be clearer, leaner, and as inspiring as possible before we began our tests with site experts. 

### Testing Procedure and Participants

At the Breakathon, we were able to test our scalable Narrative Framework with six participants where two participants were members of the Teaching Team and fours participants were students in class. While two participants were female, four participants were male.

We presented the testers with historical [site blurbs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OrAjqPtAUuV3_jJWDDqbva3-HkiPmRP63PvtmgxSom0/edit?usp=sharing) from which they can choose and base their story on their choice. After the participants finished creating their stories, we interviewed them and recorded their feedback using a google form.

### Takeaways and Action Plan

In order to analyse the feedback collected, we identified the overlapping themes in the interview summaries. Then, we visualised these overlapping themes using a Rainbow Sheet where each participant is identified by a unique color. If a participant expressed an idea that overlaps with the commonly identified themes, then we marked their response on the sheet using their unique color. You may view the commonly identified themes and participant observations under the "Observations" tab of the below sheet. In the "Summary" tab, we listed the research questions, answers to these quests and resulting action items. Our primary findings can also be found under this tab.
