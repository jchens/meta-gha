We focused testing our narrative framework in two stages:
1. Testing how site experts used our framework to create stories, at the end of Spring Quarter
1. Initial clarity testing mid-Spring Quarter, after developing the Narrative Framework in early Spring.


# 1. Site Expert Testing 
We tested our Narrative Framework with site experts such as historians, academics, historical site directors as well as Stanford tour guides. At the start of the testing sessions, we introduced the task of designing a historical story for GHA and presented how the narrative framework could be applied to an example historical site. After having the experts work on their story and complete the provided worksheets, we collected their feedback using the form below.

## Site Experts

### Matt Shimura
Matt Shimura is an Associate Technical Project Manager at Meta and he crafted two historical stories that take place at the Capitol Hill building. His feedback helped us refine our narrative framework in a way that the prompts are more clear and that there is more scaffolding provided for story creation.


### Julia Milani
Julia Milani studied History at Stanford University and was a tour guide on campus. The setting of her story is Roble Arts Gym and her feedback helped us revise the instructions on how to use the narrative framework.

We specifically reached out to Julia because tour guides were already familiar with storytelling and making historical sites engaging to audiences. Since Julia hadn't ever created stories for VR before, it would be interesting to see how she did making a new story about a familiar topic in a new medium.  


## Matt's interview: Takeaways & action items
Each interview presents the site expert testers an opportunity to create unique stories. Therefore, we analyzed each interview summary individually and created interview reports listing the action items that resulted from that particular interview.

### Positive
üåü Matt thought his initial brainstorming was well facilitated by the framework.

üåü He appreciate the inclusion of the story arc chart, which let him map his plot points.

üåü He enjoyed having our research as a high level kickstart.

### Constructive
üö® Matt enjoyed the framework definitions & guidelines, thought it was too generalized & open-ended.
* ‚úÖ To address this, we expanded the informational slides about the plot, user, and characters to include guiding questions & examples.
* ‚úÖ In addition, we modified the mad-libs worksheets to be more specific about how the user could interact with characters to move the story along, like gaining information or helping them with a task.

üö® Matt was also confused about the order of the slide deck and when to fill in certain slides. 
* ‚úÖ To address this, we pruned the deck to only include essential information and reordered the testing procedure to flow better.

### Positive

üåü Julia thought the footage and visual examples of Mesa Verde were super helpful.

üåü She also thought that the template provided by the worksheets made it very clear how to create the story.

üåü "I could not allow myself to make it complicated. The purpose of this character or the purpose of this location is clear."

### Constructive
üö® Julia wasn't sure on some slides if they were meant to be filled in and which were purely informational.
* ‚úÖ To address this, we labeled the editable worksheets with explicit instructions to "Fill me in!" for clarity.

üö® 
was not sure what was going on until the example was shown. She was not sure if she was creating a whole VR experience or just the story itself. It was super clear after thee video was shown


# 2. Breakathon 
[üìù Breakathon Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/xwaPGE6kcFQQoUAX9)

The class Breakathon was our first chance to test the initial draft of our scalable Narrative Framework! While our users were not Site Experts, we were excited to use this opportunity to primarily test the framework's **clarity** and **creative inspiration**. 

From the session, we hoped to adapt the narrative framework to be clearer, leaner, and as inspiring as possible before we began our tests with site experts. 

## Testing Procedure and Participants

At the Breakathon, we were able to test our scalable Narrative Framework with six participants. Two participants were members of the Teaching Team, and four participants were students in class. And while two participants were female, four participants were male.

We presented the testers with historical [site blurbs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OrAjqPtAUuV3_jJWDDqbva3-HkiPmRP63PvtmgxSom0/edit?usp=sharing) from which they can choose one to base their story on.

In addition, we provided participants with various printed info cards about the narrative elements essential to the story, like the plot or characters.

After the participants finished creating their stories, we interviewed them and recorded their feedback using a google form.

In order to analyze the feedback collected, we identified the overlapping themes in the interview summaries. Then, we visualized these overlapping themes using a Rainbow Sheet where each participant is identified by a unique color. If a participant expressed an idea that overlaps with the commonly identified themes, then we marked their response on the sheet using their unique color. You may view the commonly identified themes and participant observations under the "Observations" tab.

In the "Summary" tab, we listed the research questions, answers to these quests and resulting action items. Our primary findings can also be found under this tab.

# 3. Meta Feedback

Throughout our process, we received a lot of great feedback from Hassan Karaouni, our liaison from Meta. Below are a few key product decisions we've made with his help.

üëâ **Focusing on scalability** 

Originally, we drafted our contract of deliverables to focus primarily on delivering a more comprehensive Mesa Verde and trivia prototype. To that, Hassan suggested that since what we developed already was promising and valuable, we should focus more on evaluating if it was viable to scale our narrative approach across sites. This set the scene for a key deliverable of this quarter.

üëâ **Linear or not?**

Based on Hassan's recommendation, we chose to not emphasize a linear story as wouldn't adapt well to a VR format. As Hassan mentioned, with other VR applications such as National Geographic VR, they found that the linear structure of exploration was frustrating to users. But having one linear segment such as the introduction of the site by a single character (like Colel the farmer does in our Mesa Verde prototype) would be a good way to kickstart the experience and orient the user.

üëâ **Selecting stakeholders for testing**

Hassan mentioned that for his team, past stakeholders have been park rangers or tour hosts. This is because those jobs involve thinking through strong narratives, providing introductions to an audience and guiding them through sites. We followed the same logic when selecting our users for testing.
