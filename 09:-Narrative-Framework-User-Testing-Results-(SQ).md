We focused our Narrative Testing framework in two stages (1) Site Expert Testing at the end of Spring Quarter and (2) Initial clarity testing mid-Spring Quarter after developing the Narrative Framework in early Spring. Please find the most recent Site Expert testing at the top and the initial clarity testing from the Breakathon below. 

# 1. Site Expert Testing 
We tested our Narrative Framework with Site Expert such as historians, academics, historical site directors as well as Stanford tour guides. At the start of the testing sessions, we introduced the site experts the task of designing a historical story for GHA and presented how the narrative framework could be applied to an example historical site.

*Note on why we tested with tour guides -- this was a unique contribution Meta hasn't spent much time on, there whole job is making the sites ENGAGING

TODO Etc. any other expert test sessions -- ie. note about all email attempts sent out, responses back from the most recent batch with photos at Cantor, email from Jessica's history prof connection 


### Takeaways and Action Plan

# 2. Breakathon 
The class Breakathon was our first chance to test the first draft of our scalable Narrative Framework! While our users were not Site Experts, we were excited to use this opportunity to primarily test the framework's **clarity** and **creative inspiration**. 

From the session, we hoped to adapt the narrative framework to be clearer, leaner, and as inspiring as possible before we began our tests with site experts.
