# Getting Started
To get started with Unity, we began by watching several tutorials that were catered towards development for the Oculus Quest 2. These tutorials can be found in the resources below. We have made a general outline below to help guide you through getting started. For any questions, feel free to contact Jessica (jchens@stanford.edu) or Nick (nickvo@stanford.edu).

## Setting up the environment
1. First, download Unity Hub. You can access the most updated version [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
1. Once you have downloaded Unity Hub, you can now open the program and login with your Unity Account.
1. After you have logged in, navigate to the install tab and install the most updated editor. When installing the editor, make sure to include the Android Build Support Tools module.
1. You can now create your first project!


## Creating a project
When working in VR development, you have the choice to work with existing packages that support your development. We outline how to work with the two most popular packages: XR Interaction Toolkit and VR Toolkit.

### XR Interaction Toolkit
1. Create a new project through Unity Hub using the VR core template.
1. Go to window > package manager. In the packages drop-down select unity registry. Scroll down to download and install XR Interaction Toolkit.
1. Go to edit > project settings. Navigate to XR plug-in management using the sidebar. Check the boxes for Oculus under desktop and android settings.
1. You are now ready to start working on your project!

### VR Toolkit
1. Clone the VRTK Repository [here](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK).
1. In Unity Hub, add a new project from the disk and select the cloned repository.
1. Update and install your editor to match the version.
1. You are now ready to work with VRTK! You can view a sample project in Assets > VRTK > Samples.


## Building and running your project
1. First, enable developer mode on your Oculus headset. You can do this by accessing the settings within the headset environment or using the mobile companion App.
1. Once you have completed this, link the headset to your computer using the usb-c cable. You will be prompted in the headset to allow access. Allow access using the controllers.
1. In the unity editor, go to file > build settings. Select Android and switch platform -- this may take a while. 
1. Once you have switched platforms, add the scene by selecting "Add Open Scene."
1. Select "Build and Run." This may take a while to build. Once complete you can put on your headset and run your project!
