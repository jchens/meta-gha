# Demo Prototype

We received an amazing response and insightful feedback from rapid prototyping, and felt ready to create a medium fidelity prototype in preparation for demo day. With this iteration, we made a few significant product decisions:

### Finalizing the Location
To ensure that we were focusing most of our time on creating an engaging game instead of just conducting research on the Tomb of Tu Duc, we decided to adapt the existing script attached for site visits to Mesa Verde in GHA. Since all the historical details were already well researched, we could use it as a solid foundation for our next prototype. 

### Selecting Characters & POVs
Based on the Mesa Verde script, we were able to identify 3 POVs we could focus on for our user's journey through Mesa Verde: the farmer, the builder, and the artisan. We chose these POVs because they represented key roles in the Ancestral Pueblo community, and had the potential for historically significant and culturally relevant learning opportunities.

### Refining the Game Structure
Considering our 3 characters, we mapped out the structure and interactions of our game. Each character would have its own XOI (experience of interest) that covers their narrative, site location, interactions, and historical information. 

Then to complete their mission and finish exploring Mesa Verde, our user can participate in a game-show-esque trivia game about the knowledge they just gained. By answering enough questions correctly, they can earn a badge for their passport, marking their trip as complete... for now.
