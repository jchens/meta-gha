# Prototype
One of the key concerns for Meta's Global Historical Archive was retaining users to stay in sites longer and visit more locations. To address this problem, we took two approaches:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Make the experience at sites more engaging (Explore Mesa Verde)
Instead of the user going on a virtual tour of the site, we reframed the experience to make the user an integral part of an interactive story, weaving the educational portions in to encourage unintentional learning. Users can interact with various residents of a pueblo dealing with a wildfire, learning about their role in the community and providing direct assistance.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Motivate users to explore other site (Trivia)
To give users a reason to learn beyond their own desire for education, we introduced a rewards system through the passport & trivia game show. At any point in their exploration, users can start a trivia game show that covers the knowledge shared from the residents about the community and their roles. We found that this approach motivated users to explore
This motivates users to explore more of the site, leading to a **1.3x increase in XOIs (experiences of interest) visited with trivia**. Then based on the trivia performance, users are awarded with a tiered stamp in their passport, which encourages them to try the trivia with the same site to improve their score, or another site to collect more stamps.

We'll expand on these 2 approaches below.

## Trivia

Users can choose to exit anytime to enter Mesa Verde's game show! We focused on narrative-relevant questions based on the 3 perspectives showcased in Mesa Verde. Users can answer questions correctly to earn stamps that can be shown off in your passport.

### Walkthrough

To start off the game show, users are raised into the game arena as the announcer goes through introductions.
