We met with John Lilly, a venture partner at Figma to gain more insight on our idea of perception. To prepare for this presentation, we developed low-fi sketches of our initial idea and focused on further developing the rationale. You can view the final presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hAum3pAMinpqGr0E7IOS20ojcgFvhOYFbZgACu26sFo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Feedback
Our meeting with Lilly was insightful and revealed new challenges and ideas. Our main insights and tasks following the meeting are summarized below.
* Narrow down target audience — gamers specifically coming from POV-type games (Assassin's Creed, God of War, Diablo etc.)
  * God of War (Norse mythology)
  * red dead redemption 2 (western)
  * Far Cry 6 (basically Cuba)
  * Grand Theft Auto (LA)
  * Uncharted (all over)
  * Last of Us (all over)
  * Ghost of Tsushima (Japan)
  * Experience those games for ourselves
* Review user motivations — how users initially enter/re-enter the game loop
  * Look More into VR Games
    * ❓Who does Meta want to include/exclude? Gamers or non-gamers 
    * ❓Most popular games on Oculus
    * ❓What does *he* thinks makes the most engaging / popular Oculus games so good 
    * ❓How long people play these popular games
      * EX: Supernatural (~1 hour), Beat Saber (~20-30 mins) , VR Chat (~1 hours)
    * ❓What makes them want to come back
      * EX: Phone games use notifications. Single-player PC/console games don’t have a notification system.
    * May want to explore in-app notifications in Oculus
* ❓Platform feasibility
    * 📝 Come up with plan B (social) / plan C (cognition) if we can’t directly build on top GHA
      * Stand-alone prototype?
      * Present sketches at liaison meeting
    * ❓Do we have access to individual assets, worlds, character models, etc?
    * ❓Would games take away from the seriousness of the history?
    * ❓Is this in line with what Meta wants to represent?
* 📝 Visual indicator of POV
    * Does it look like Harry Potter Pensive (black and white)?
    * What does the HUD look like?
    * Can we see glimpses of the character (clothes, hands, etc.) even from a 1st person perspective?
