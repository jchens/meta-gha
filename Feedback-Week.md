We met with John Lilly, a venture partner at Figma to gain more insight on our idea of perception. To prepare for this presentation, we developed low-fi sketches of our initial idea and focused on further developing the rationale. You can view the final presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hAum3pAMinpqGr0E7IOS20ojcgFvhOYFbZgACu26sFo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Feedback
Our meeting with Lilly was insightful and revealed new challenges and ideas. Our main insights and tasks following the meeting are summarized below.
* Narrow down target audience ‚Äî gamers specifically coming from POV-type games (Assassin's Creed, God of War, Diablo etc.)
  * God of War (Norse mythology)
  * red dead redemption 2 (western)
  * Far Cry 6 (basically Cuba)
  * Grand Theft Auto (LA)
  * Uncharted (all over)
  * Last of Us (all over)
  * Ghost of Tsushima (Japan)
  * Experience those games for ourselves
* Review user motivations ‚Äî how users initially enter/re-enter the game loop
  * Look More into VR Games
    * ‚ùìWho does Meta want to include/exclude? Gamers or non-gamers 
    * ‚ùìMost popular games on Oculus
    * ‚ùìWhat does *he* thinks makes the most engaging / popular Oculus games so good 
    * ‚ùìHow long people play these popular games
      * EX: Supernatural (~1 hour), Beat Saber (~20-30 mins) , VR Chat (~1 hours)
    * ‚ùìWhat makes them want to come back
      * EX: Phone games use notifications. Single-player PC/console games don‚Äôt have a notification system.
    * May want to explore in-app notifications in Oculus
* ‚ùìPlatform feasibility
    * üìù Come up with plan B (social) / plan C (cognition) if we can‚Äôt directly build on top GHA
      * Stand-alone prototype?
      * Present sketches at liaison meeting
    * ‚ùìDo we have access to individual assets, worlds, character models, etc?
    * ‚ùìWould games take away from the seriousness of the history?
    * ‚ùìIs this in line with what Meta wants to represent?
* üìù Visual indicator of POV
    * Does it look like Harry Potter Pensive (black and white)?
    * What does the HUD look like?
    * Can we see glimpses of the character (clothes, hands, etc.) even from a 1st person perspective?


# Liaison Feedback
We met with Hassan Karaouni, Head of New Product R&D @ Facebook Reality Labs EdMod to align our ideas with the objectives of GHA project and further narrow down our product space. We incorporated Lilly's feedback, brainstormed new themes around the POV idea and came up with three directions our project can go which are found under POV Options in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vc86Vj5eylCxs-OkJDsJcPc2PU_c3xslQeXZlWBBhqI/edit?usp=sharing).

## Feedback
Karaouni noted that our story- and perspective-driven approach to this project is unique and informed us about various immersive experiences such as the Holocaust Museum and Alcatraz which we can research in order to develop our idea around implementing a POV in GHA. In the light of this feedback and discussion of our brainstormed ideas, we decided to proceed with the second POV Option we generated which is to implement a TOUR GUIDE(S) who are the Historical figures or characters and the user plays as a tourist/themselves.
