We met with John Lilly, a venture partner at Figma to gain more insight on our idea of perception. To prepare for this presentation, we developed low-fi sketches of our initial idea and focused on further developing the rationale.

Our meeting with Lilly was insightful and revealed new challenges and ideas. We summarized our main insights and tasks into 4 points to consider moving forward:
* Narrow down our target audience (gamers familiar with POV-type games (Assassin's Creed, God of War, Diablo etc.))
* Review user motivations — how do users initially enter/re-enter the game loop?
* Consider platform feasibility when deciding features
* Consider visual indicator of POV so the game concept is clear

We also met with Hassan Karaouni, Head of New Product R&D @ Facebook Reality Labs EdMod to align our ideas with the objectives of GHA project and further narrow down our product space. 

## Feedback
Hassan noted that our story- and perspective-driven approach to this project is unique and informed us about various immersive experiences such as the Holocaust Museum and Alcatraz which we can research in order to develop our idea around implementing a POV in GHA. We presented 3 POV options for our game:

1. YOU are a historical figure, and there is no tour guide
    * EX: Historical reenactments in VR made by Shell games

2. YOU are yourself, TOUR GUIDES are historical figures or characters

3. YOU are yourself, TOUR GUIDE is a regular person (not a historical figure)
    * TOUR GUIDE would lead you through games, learning features, or tutorials
    * LIMITATION – we’re worried about personifying figures and gamifying sacred sites, so this would be the safe option


In the light of this feedback and discussion of our brainstormed ideas, we decided to proceed with the **second POV option** we generated which would involve historical characters as tour guides who guide your character through various buildings, games, and other interactions.
