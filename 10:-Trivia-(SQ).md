# Introduction
In brainstorming different drivers for the exploration of GHA, we arrived on the idea of Trivia. Informed by talks with Jay Borenstein and Adam Tobin, a producer for one of the most popular game shows in America, the idea of Trivia compelled us as a technique to gamify exploration and unintentional learning. At the end of the first quarter, these efforts culminated in a low-fi version integrated within our Mesa Verde Figma Prototype [Link Here].


However, moving towards the second quarter, we wanted to further explore Trivia through a playable Unity prototype. In creating this prototype, we took a step in our journey to answer these questions:
* How can we create a Trivia experience that utilizes the capabilities of virtual reality?
* What emotions do we want our users to feel during Trivia?
* What does a trivia experience unique to each site look like?
* To what extent can Trivia motivate exploration through GHA?

The following wiki page will guide you through the process we took to answer the preceding questions.
