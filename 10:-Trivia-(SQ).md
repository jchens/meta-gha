# Introduction
In brainstorming different drivers for the exploration of GHA, we arrived on the idea of Trivia. Informed by talks with Jay Borenstein and Adam Tobin, a producer for one of the most popular game shows in America, the idea of Trivia compelled us as a technique to gamify exploration and unintentional learning. At the end of the first quarter, these efforts culminated in a low-fi version integrated within our Mesa Verde Figma Prototype [Link Here].


However, moving towards the second quarter, we wanted to further explore Trivia through a playable Unity prototype. In creating this prototype, we took a step in our journey to answer these questions:
* How can we create a Trivia experience that utilizes the capabilities of virtual reality?
* What does a trivia experience unique to each site look like?
* To what extent can Trivia motivate exploration through GHA?

The following wiki page will guide you through the process we took to answer the preceding questions.

## :joystick: Creating a VR Trivia Experience
At the end of the winter quarter, our initial trivia prototype in Figma was designed as an overlay within the user's HUD. Moving forward, we wanted to explore what interactions engaged the user in a form that utilized the potential of virtual reality. The following section addresses how these design decisions were informed.

## User Journey
Through user testing, we found that there are three key motivators for those who choose to complete Trivia:
1. Trivia as a internal reward system
2. Trivia as a competition
3. Guided learning, to preview the site

## Trivia and GHA Exploration
To test the potential of this trivia experience to motivate GHA exploration, we integrated it with our previous prototype. Conducting A/B tests, we presented the prototype of Mesa Verde either with or without the option to conduct the trivia. While the users tested, we took metrics such as:
* Number of POI's Explored
* Session Time
* User Flow (Do they return to Mesa Verde, Replay, or Explore a New Site)

The following table summarizes our quantitative findings:

After their experience, we then conducted a survey to gauge the user's motivation for engaging with trivia as well as ...
