s

**Character** User is an “artifact assistant” 

**Goal** Character wants to be promoted to an archeologist expert 

**How Will They Accomplish Goal** Interacting with XOIs and gaining knowledge about the different parts of Mesa Verde (while enjoying themselves) so they can pass the mesa verde archeological board (ie. trivia game)  


## Intro (Narrator)

Welcome to the historic Mesa Verda. Around 600AD, people living in the Four Corners region made Mesa Verde their home. For more than 700 years, they and their descendants lived here, building elaborate stone cliff dwellings, which you will explore today. 

Inhabitants of Mesa Verde are renowned for their artisanship, buildmanship, and agricultural prowess. On your journey, you will interact with an Artisan, a Builder, and a Farmer in search of the secrets of this site. Impressive and mystifying, much about Mesa Verde is still unknown to researchers and archeologists. On your journey, you are an artifact assistant with a thirst for knowledge and a desire to be promoted and renowned as a true archeological expert. Few know the true history and tales of Mesa Verde and we need you to interview historical figures, dig through artifacts, and pass the Mesa Verde archeological board earning the gold badge, representing the highest honor of Archeological Expert.

## FARMER XOI (Experience of Interest)

### POI#1 (monologue): 
By nature, I’m a provider. My ancestors and I have been growing Maize, or “corn” as you might know it, since 450 CE, making up 75-80% of the diet of my fellow Pueblans. After we’ve grown the Maize (corn), it is our tradition to grind it before we cook it. While corn is my specialty and what I am best known for, I’ve also developed skills growing beans and squash, passed down from my family.  

For many many years before 1100, farmers lived near their crops but my people represent a historic shift of farmers who chose to leave near sources of water and walk long distances to reach their crops. As a farmer, I feel at home in Mesa Verde and make up the backbone and large percent of the population of this dwelling. 


### IX #1: MINIGAME
Minigame: Help the farmer locate the tool they need to prepare the corn in the traditional Mesa Verde way before they cook it 

“I’m glad you’re here because I was just about to prepare a recent corn crop for cooking, I’ve seemed to have misplaced some of my tools. Can you help me [find the tools I need to ] prepare the corn?” 

### Original Meta Script: 
Maize, also known as corn, originated in Meso-America and was grown in Mesa Verde beginning around 450 CE. Along with beans and squash, corn was a mainstay of the Ancestral Pueblo diet, making up 75-80% of what they consumed. Ancestral Pueblo farmers found ways to adapt to Mesa Verde's temperate climates by becoming skilled at dryland farming and growing drought-tolerant varieties of corn that would mature quickly to accommodate a short growing season.

Corn was traditionally prepared using a mano (a handheld stone tool) and metate (the larger stone mortar), which were used for grinding corn before it was cooked. 



### POI#2 (monologue):
The arid climate around here is not easy-growing conditions, and I’ve had to become skilled at dryland farming to adapt to Mesa Verde’s temperate climate. Some ways I’ve learned to combat the dry weather and short farming seasons is to grow drought-tolerant varieties of Maize that mature quickly. 

The dryness is not the only part of the climate that makes farming difficult here. My ancestors and I have had to learn how to navigate frequent lightning strikes and inundation of dense overgrowth. 

### Original Meta Script: 
Due to an arid climate, frequent lightning strikes, and inundation of dense overgrowth, Mesa Verde has experienced numerous large-scale wildfires over the past few decades. From 1996-2003, five major wildfires burned over 50% of the park's acreage. Fires like these put alcove cliff dwellings at risk, allow invasive plants to overtake the old-growth Pinyon-Juniper forests, and make the soil hydrophobic by creating a waxy layer on top of the soil's surface. As a result, water rushed into gullies, causing erosion that uncovered previously unknown archeological sites and artifacts and exposing burial sites sacred to the Pueblo people.



## POV Motivation

# Feedback from Adam Tobin
TODO

# Feedback from Script Consultant

With help from Adam, we connected with Sofia, who has experience with screenwriting and writing historical fiction.

### Feedback Summary:
* Give your user (the main character) a better reason to be there and to interact with the other characters. They should be motivated by an external goal and not just assumed to be motivated by a desire to learn.
    * We want the other characters to say "We need you! You're the only one who can help."
* Flesh out the Farmer/Artisan/Builder characters: they should have names and unique traits.

## Opening Scene 
_User enters Mesa Verde and can acclimate / wander around for 30 secs_

_Colel, a farmer, approaches you and says:_


[Colel]: "Ah! We’re so happy you’ve made it here safely after your long journey! Lightning struck our dry, dry community yesterday, and we’ve managed to put out the fire but we need you to help us get our home back in order. We don’t have enough hands ourselves as a small dwelling / village mostly of farmers like myself who are busy with our Maize crops and we’re so glad an archeological expert like you has come along. We won’t be able to get this place in shape without you!"

[Colel]: "I need some help myself now as many of my tools were destroyed in the lightning fire, and I need to start preparing some Maize for cooking. I know my friends Humberto, one of our trusty builders and Izel, an artisan here, also need your help. Come with me and I can tell you more about our village and you can help me prepare the corn."

Map Text:
_Meet Colel the farmer at his farming terrace, which he built himself to collect moisture as a useful dryland farming technique._

He needs our help after lots of his tools were destroyed in the lightning fire.



### POI #1 (monologue):
[Colel]: "By nature, I’m a provider. My ancestors and I have been growing Maize, or “corn” as people in your time know it, since 450 CE, making up the vast majority of the diet of my fellow Pueblans. After we’ve grown the Maize (corn), it is our tradition to grind it before we cook it. While corn is my specialty and what I am best known for, I’ve also developed skills growing beans and squash, passed down from my family.

### IX #1: MINIGAME  

[Colel:] “I’m glad you’re here because my tools have been strewn about in the chaos of the fire, and I can’t find the right one to prepare my corn in the traditional Mesa Verde way, finely ground up. Can you help me?”

**Minigame:** Help the farmer locate the tool they need to prepare the corn in the traditional Mesa Verde way before they cook it 


### POI #2 (monologue): 
[Colel]: "The arid climate around here is not easy-growing conditions, and I’ve had to become skilled at dryland farming to adapt to Mesa Verde’s temperate climate.

Map text:
_Meet Izel the artisan at the Step House alcove, where basketmakers, potters, and other artisans created works of art._

_She needs our help recovering the pots damaged in the fire. Press A to visit her._

### POI #1 (monologue):
[Izel]: "Oh, how it’s good to see you! Colel and Aapo said you were coming but I didn’t know if I could believe my ears! My husband Aapo and I are artisans here, but so much has gone wrong with the small lightning fire. 

We used to weave waterproof baskets for carrying water, storing grain, and cooking, which would have burned right up. Thankfully, our ancestors switched from making baskets to pottery around 550AD, constucting pots, bowls, canteens, ladles, jars, and mugs with just their hands and wet clay. We have such a surplus of pottery that we share and trade them with our neighboring communities… [worried] but some were damaged in the fire and I’m worried it will disrupt our trading. We could use your help with the new pots!"  


### POI #2 (monologue):  
[Izel]: "But we cannot let this fire take us down, we respect nature’s power and her beauty. One of my favorite murals on the third floor of one of our room blocks is said to be a portrayal of nature. 
The red band at the bottom could symbolize the earth, while the lighter portion of the wall could represent the sky. The triangular peaks on the horizon line represent our surrounding mountains. The rectangular element in the sky shows Her power, embodying clouds, rain, or the sun and the moon. And the dotted line could showcase cracks in the earth."

Map text:
Meet Humberto the builder at Cliff Palace, an exceptionally large cliff dwelling with at least 150 rooms.

_He needs our help constructing a new kiva, an underground room used for dances, ceremonies, and gatherings._

### POI #1 (monologue):

[Humberto]: "My name is Humberto, and I help build the sandstone structures plastered together by the adobe mortar that you’ve seen! Amidst the lightning scare, community members hid out for safety in our Kivas, important community structures I’d like to tell you more about! 

Our village is known as The Balcony House and you’ve already had the chance to meet and help some of our 30 community members that live in this cliff dwelling. 

The structures I’ve helped to build are important centers for trading and gathering. Two of the most important structures here, as you might know, are our Kivas. These are roofed underground structures that play an important role in my fellow Puebloans daily life! They act as our religious, economic, and government centers for our entire community. More importantly, their roofs also act as a central courtyard where daily work and living takes place. 

Within Kivas, we have siapus, symbolic features that are said to represent the hole through which humans climbed into this world. This sacred design indicates that kivas are a focal point for our ritual activites at the household level."
