# 0. Initial Script Direction 

## Screenwriting and Game Show Expert Advice 
We met with Adam Tobin, renowned game show producer and scriptwriter, to gain some insight on how to make our historical world exciting and our trivia portion engaging. 

He inspired us to pursue an immersive story experience and suggested we think about framing our story and trivia as a package through one of these lenses:
* Game show 
* Mystery 
* Choose-Your-Own-Adventure 

He also emphasized the importance of **character** and giving our users a purpose and imagining an appealing journey for them, complete with feel-good rewards. He pushed us to motivate the user to move through the space and not to assume they will know where to go, or even want to, without direction in the form of inspiration. 

Being a game show expert, Adam gave us insightful tips on how to make our trivia feel more like a game and less like a quiz (ie. rewards for being correct, some form of playful stakes, and non-traditional questions like placing character quotes). 

## POV Motivation
We decided to pursue the XOI (experiences of interest) and POV (point of view) format to expose our users to a broad set of historical characters. We chose this direction to accomplish unintentional learning and to achieve an ever-changing and customizable environment to keep users engaged. We wanted to motivate our user to move through the world, and having more than one character to learn about, talk to, relate to, (and eventually help in our Final Draft) seemed like a great place to start. 
This direction also allowed us to integrate diverse historical facts about Mesa Verde more naturally. We can subtly and engagingly convey facts that fit in with a specific character's role (ie. farming facts, building facts, and artisan facts)


# 1. Mid-way Draft
## Story Outline / Goals 
**Target Audience:** Adults who want to learn more about history (focusing on young adults 20-30s)

**Character:** User is an “artifact assistant” 

**Goal:** Character wants to be promoted to an archeologist expert 

**How Will They Accomplish Goal:** Interacting with XOIs and gaining knowledge about the different parts of Mesa Verde (while enjoying themselves) so they can pass the mesa verde archeological board (ie. trivia game)

## Mid-way draft feedback from historical fiction consultant 

With help from Adam, we connected with one of his senior students, Sofia Monroy who has experience with screenwriting and writing historical fiction.

### Feedback Summary:
* Make the user the main character 
* Make the user an **actor** and work to satisfy and amp up their ego 
* Give your user a better reason to be there and to interact with the other characters. They should be motivated by an external goal -- do not just assume they are motivated by a desire to learn.
* Have the other characters to say "We need you! You're the only one who can help."
* Flesh out the Farmer/Artisan/Builder characters: they should have names and unique traits.
* Know your audience better to hook them in
* Audience needs drama to be **entertained** and need a call-to-action to be **engaged**

# 2. Final Draft

## Main Improvements from Mid-way Draft: 
* We named our characters, which immediately gave them more personality, and fleshed out their role in the society and interaction with one another
* Defined our user as our main character and gave them a more compelling role (ie. community members *NEED* the user's help to get their home back in shape)
* Introduced a true **problem** -- the lightning fire natural disaster, which we sourced from historical research of Mesa Verde (Sources: Original Meta script for Mesa Verde, Khan Academy) 
* Scraped generic historical background and third-party narrator and used our characters to motivate every action and every historical fact (ie. Colel the farmer runs up to the user after they enter the world to give the run down rather than a generic historical narrator)
* Action and problem starts right away
* Each character POI is associated with an intentional location to increase the story 

## Story Outline / Goals
**Scene:** The year is 1250AD and lightning has struck Mesa Verde and the Pueblan people need help 
**User Character:** User is an archaeologist expert who is here to help the Puebloan people 
**Other Characters: **
* Colel – farmer 
* Humberto – builder
* Izel – artisan 
* Aapo – artisan 

**Goal:** “Interview” the Pueblan people to understand their struggles from the lightning fire and help them as a knowledgeable archeologist, then pass the Time Travel Trivia to make it back home and earn a gold badge from the Mayan leader to take with you to thank you for your help
