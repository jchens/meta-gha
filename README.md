# Project Synopsis
We are excited to explore positive gamification of historical education through researching and utilizing some of these techniques: 
- Meeting up with others around the world at historical sights. How do we make these GATHERING spaces 
- Interactive walls where you can leave messages and momentos for others (remincent of "lock bridges" in Paris) 
- Storyline games throughout different historical locations (Poptripica inspired, mini games!) 
- Take the perspective of a different type of person every time you travel to a location (different profession, different social class)
- You're an archelogist! Excavate ruins and find treature 
- See the transformation of historical sites over time every time you visit
