[[Rapid Prototype - Figma]](https://www.figma.com/proto/AU8g3yvfUa9y78Gpql5tAv/Rapid-Prototype%3A-Tomb-of-Tu-Duc?node-id=98%3A222&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=6%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1)

We considered numerous historical points of interest for our initial prototype, and ultimately decided on the Tomb of Emperor Tu Duc due to its potential for strong perspectives (like Emperor Tu Duc himself) and new knowledge that most people wouldn't already have.

## Goals
After additional research and brainstorming, we narrowed in on our idea to use first-person narratives from historical characters to provide an engaging and informative experience for the user as they explore the historical site. For example, as the user visits the Stele Pavilion inside the Tomb of Tu Duc, they would hear Tu Duc himself talking about the biography inside the pavilion instead of a narrator simply listing facts.

Our key goals were to:
* Connect the user to cultural history
* Build empathy through different perspectives
* Engage and incentivize the users

## Details
To accomplish this, we envisioned 4 areas of interaction for our prototype:
1. **Map**: Users can walk around and see the buildings and landmarks associated with the Tomb of Tu Duc
2. **Narrative**: Users can listen to poems read by Emperor Tu Duc himself, detailing his life.
3. **Minigame**: Users can participate in activities that Tu Duc and citizens of the time would do.
4. **Trivia**: Users can earn a badge of completion by answering questions about the knowledge they just gained.

## Figma
To achieve and test these goals, we created a low-fidelity prototype using Figma.

## Gathering User Feedback
To make sure we were meeting those goals, we tested our prototype with 8 individuals in our target audience. After observing their interactions, we followed up 2 ways to quantify and qualify their experience :

* **User Survey**: Rank enjoyment & perceived learning of their narrative and trivia experience separately (Likert scale 1-5)

* **User Interview**
    * What was your favorite part of the experience? 
    * What was your least favorite part? 
    * & other follow-up questions

# Conclusions

We're so proud of all the prototyping and testing we were able to accomplish during a short period of time. We got great feedback and we were very honored to receive the "Best Overall" award out of all prototypes.

Synthesizing all of our results, we arrived at two key points to keep in mind going forward:

#### 1. Narrative was peopleâ€™s favorite part
    ðŸ”œ Immersive experience
    ðŸ”œ Ability to move and interact
#### 2. Users enjoy consuming trivia content intentionally
    ðŸ”œ Emphasize narrative-relevant questions
    ðŸ”œ Allow access anytime from toolkit
