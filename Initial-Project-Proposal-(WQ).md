## Initial Brainstorming

Our brainstorming process began with individually researching interesting game mechanics & dynamics that could be implemented in GHA. After this individual process, we consolidated these features ideas into several themes.

## Themes
* Adding friends, advanced chat
* Mini games/activities
* Different perspectives
* Learning through exploration
* Learning through time
* Reward systems
* Collectibles

## Exploring the Opportunity Space

To brainstorm concrete ideas for features to be placed into GHA, we had to first explore the opportunity space and familiarize ourselves with as many popular games and relevant experiences as possible. This led us to play-test and research numerous games, including Minecraft and Uncharted. Using these experiences, we identified key features that stood out to us and proposed how they might be integrated into GHA.

## Existing Feature Tier Rankings

To prepare for the project proposal, we also thought of existing game features and ranked them into three tiers according to how much we wanted them in our final project: (1) must-have, (2) nice-to-have, and (3) not-needed. 

## Initial User Interviews

To develop more insight into potential users/features for GHA, we also interviewed a diverse pool of participants based on their travel, gaming, and VR experience.

### Notable quotes:
_‚ÄúBeing able to immerse myself in the culture and people of the historical theme [of Assassin's Creed] led to a lot of unintentional learning._

_For example, Assassin's Creed: Syndicate was about the Second Industrial Revolution in London, and you could meet & interact with people like Charles Dickens and Alexander Graham Bell during missions.‚Äù_

_‚ÄúI think it would be cool to explore the [different] perspective[s] of someone living during a historical time, and someone viewing it through present lens, as a tourist or archeologist. I can imagine that it really adds to the immersive and emotional impact of the story playing out.‚Äù_

## Three Themes
After many rounds of researching and ranking features, we arrived at the three main themes our project could focus on: cognition, perception, and social. 

**Cognition** ‚Äì Gamify learning facts, figures, trivia
* HMW enable learning by creating interactive, hands-on games about historical sites?
* HMW enable learning about historical sites from completing quests and following a storyline?
* HMW enable learning about historical sites from engaging with the people or artifacts in game?

**Perception** ‚Äì Step into historically accurate shoes 
* HMW make adopting different perspectives in the same space realistic? 
* HMW help users step into others‚Äô shoes to understand different ways of life?
* HMW help users step into others‚Äô shoes to understand inequities?

**Social** ‚Äì Sharing the experience
* HMW create meaningful connections for strangers through gathering spaces at historical sites?
* HMW enrich the exploration process by allowing friends to explore historical sites together?

Using the three themes, we conducted research to find examples, user experiences, and academic articles that supported our rationale, and consolidated our findings in our project proposal presentation.
