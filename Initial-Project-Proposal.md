To prepare for the project proposal, we brainstormed features and ranked them into three tiers: (1) must-have, (2) nice-to-have, and (3) not-needed. After ranking these features, we arrived at the three main themes of cognition, perception, and social.


## Three Themes
Using the three themes of cognition, perception, and social we conducted research to find examples, user experiences, and academic articles that supported our rationale. We then consolidated our findings in a presentation.
